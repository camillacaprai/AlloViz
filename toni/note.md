# Major problems
- There are no tests (normal or regression tests)
- Make a list of imports without versions, or it can't be used
- Removing files from packages confuses the history, impedes updates from upstream, and saves no space. May also be seen as unnecessary tweaks to the original work.
- By all means keep the packages as they are, if possible. Tweak the path instead of making relative imports
- Relies on vmd-python which violates VMD license

#Â Minor
- Lazy import via exec is weird
- Filtering methods should be lower case

# Resolved
- getcontacts relies on vmd-python which seems outdated. I made a patch to have it work on new macs
