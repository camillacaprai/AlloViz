# Summary

*MDEntropy* is a Python package for information-theoretic (IT) analysis of data
generated from molecular dynamics simulations. While correlation studies
have long been of interest to the molecular dynamics (MD) community
[@mccammon, @mcclendon], IT tools to analyze MD trajectories have been much
less developed. *MDEntropy* seeks to fill this niche by providing an
easy-to-use Python API that works seamlessly with other Python packages, such
as ``mdtraj``, ``msmbuilder``, and ``numpy`` [@mdtraj, @numpy, @msmbuilder].

Functionality in *MDEntropy* is centered around ``mdtraj`` trajectories and the
statistical tools available in ``msmbuilder``. Leveraging these tools allows
for statistically robust analyses of many IT estimators across a variety of
biomolecular feature-spaces [@schreiber, @grassberger].

*MDEntropy* is actively developed and maintained by researchers at Stanford
University. Source code for *MDEntropy* is hosted on GitHub and is
continuously archived to Zenodo [@mdent_archive]. Full documentation, including
Jupyter Notebook tutorials, can be found at
[http://msmbuilder.org/mdentropy](http://msmbuilder.org/mdentropy).
