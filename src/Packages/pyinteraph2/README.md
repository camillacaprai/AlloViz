# PyInteraph2

PyInteraph2 is a software suite designed to identify intramolecular interactions
from protein ensembles and join them in a graph representation, which can be used to identify
pathways of structural communication. It includes Python and C libraries and 
front-end scripts as well as a PyMOL plugin, Interaction Plotter, which is designed to plot the
interactions on the protein three-dimensional structure.

The package can be found [here](https://github.com/ELELAB/pyinteraph2), together with a comprehensive
tutorial and test data set. The test data set also includes instructions on the
format of the configuration files and instructions on how to install and use the Interaction Plotter
plugin. It also includes a bash file with several use tests and useful comments
on the various flags available to the user.

Installation instructions and requirements are found in the INSTALL file.
